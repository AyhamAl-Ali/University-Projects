Please note..

- To run this project you will need a web-server or a localhost to make Javascript codes work,
- You can either run it using php localhost using 'php -S localhost:8000' (terminal command) OR using XAMPP.

* Running these html files without a server will not make the header nor the footer run.

* OR use this live example (hope it still works in the future ;) ): https://opg4mers.com/iot

* This project has been developed my Ayham A-Ali (201910486)
